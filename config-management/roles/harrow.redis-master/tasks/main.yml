#  WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low
#  memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to
#  /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl
#  vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
#
#  WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel.
#  This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue
#  run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as
#  root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a
#  reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
